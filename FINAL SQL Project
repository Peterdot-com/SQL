# For my final SQL project, I devised five questions I sought to learn about the Chinook database.

-- 1.  Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.                                                           

SELECT customers.firstname, customers.lastname, invoices.InvoiceID, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers 
ON invoices.customerid = customers.customerid
WHERE invoices.billingcountry = "Brazil";
         
-- 2. Provide a query that shows all the tracks, and include the album name, media type, and genre 

SELECT t.name AS 'Track Name', a.title AS 'Album Title', m.name AS'Media Type', g.name AS 'Genre' 
FROM chinook.tracks t 
JOIN chinook.Albums a
ON a.AlbumId =t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m 
ON m.MediaTypeId= t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.genreId= t.genreId;

-- 3.  What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- 4.  Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the invoice table

SELECT DISTINCT(BillingCountry)
FROM chinook.invoices;

-- 5.  how Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the USA.

SELECT firstname, lastname, customerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA"
